# GangGo - Diaspora in GoLang

GangGo is a decentralized social network written in [GoLang](https://golang.org/). It uses the same federation library like [Diaspora](https://diasporafoundation.org/) and therefore can participate in conversations like any other [Pod](https://the-federation.info/nodes)!

## Choose A Pod

[Here](https://the-federation.info/ganggo) you'll find a list of all publicly listed GangGo servers.

## Selfhost

Fetch the latest updater version [![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/ganggo/ganggo/alpha/images/download.svg)](https://bintray.com/ganggo/ganggo/alpha/_latestVersion) and execute it. It will come with a small installation wizard and guide you through the first steps.

There is also a small installation video for how to quick-start with our updater binary on [ganggo.github.io](https://ganggo.github.io/)!

## Development

Please have a look at our [documentation page](https://ganggo.github.io/development.html)!
